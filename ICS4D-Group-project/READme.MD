# Bank Queue Simulation (FCFS Model)

This project simulates a basic First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) queue at a bank using **C++**.

## Assignment Description

We were tasked with creating a program in Java or C++ to simulate 100 customers arriving at a bank.  
- Arrival times are uniformly distributed between **1 and 8 minutes**.  
- Service times are uniformly distributed between **1 and 6 minutes**.  
- The program computes queue statistics such as arrival time, service start, waiting time, service end, and time in system.

The output is displayed in a well-formatted table.
